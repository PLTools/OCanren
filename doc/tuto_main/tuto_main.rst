We begin with studying a "hello world" program, exposing various aspects of the technicalities of the language. After that, we go deep down into one of the most important: understanding and defining user types. Afterwards we will be ready to write non-trivial relational programs. we define a simple relational data base, followed by a library for Peano numbers.

In the last lesson we use OCanren to solve an arithmetic puzzle. The last three lessons are so ordered that the complexity of the examples increases gently.
