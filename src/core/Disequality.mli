type t

(* [empty] empty disequality constraint store *)
val empty : t

(* [add env subst diseq x y] adds constraint [x =/= y] into disequality constraint store *)
val add : Env.t -> Subst.t -> t -> 'a -> 'a -> t option

(* [recheck env subst diseq bindings] - checks that disequality is not violated in refined substitution.
 *   [bindings] is a substitution prefix, i.e. new bindings obtained during unification.
 *   This function may rebuild internal representation of constraints and thus it returns new object.
 *   If constraint is violated then [None] is returned.

(* [project env subst diseq fv] - projects [diseq] into the set of free-variables [fv],
 *   i.e. it extracts only those constraints that are relevant to variables from [fv]
