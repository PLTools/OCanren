(* [unify ~subsume ~scope env subst x y] performs unification of two terms [x] and [y] in [subst].
 *   Unification is a process of finding substituion [s] s.t. [s(x) = s(y)].
 *   Returns [None] if two terms are not unifiable.
 *   Otherwise it returns a pair of diff and new substituion.
 *   Diff is a list of pairs (var, term) that were added to the original substituion.
 *
 *   If [subsume] argument is passed and [true] then substituion binds variables only from left term,
 *   (i.e. it returns [s] s.t. [s(x) = y]).
 *   This can be used to perform subsumption check:
 *   [y] is subsumed by [x] (i.e. [x] is more general than [x]) if such a unification succeeds.
