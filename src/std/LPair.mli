open Logic

(** Type synonym to prevent toplevel [logic] from being hidden *)
@type 'a logic' = 'a logic with show, gmap, html, eq, compare, foldl, foldr, fmt

(** Synonym for regular option type *)
@type ('a, 'b) t = 'a * 'b with show, gmap, html, eq, compare, foldl, foldr, fmt

(** Ground option (the regular one) *)
@type ('a, 'b) ground = 'a * 'b with show, gmap, html, eq, compare, foldl, foldr, fmt

(** Logic option *)
@type ('a, 'b) logic = ('a * 'b) logic' with show, gmap, html, eq, compare, foldl, foldr, fmt

(** Logic injection (for reification) *)
val inj : ('a -> 'c) -> ('b -> 'd) -> ('a, 'b) ground -> ('c, 'd) logic

(** A synonym for injected pair *)
type ('a, 'b, 'c, 'd) groundi = (('a, 'c) ground, ('b, 'd) logic) injected

(** Make injected pair from ground one with injected components *)
val pair : ('a, 'b) injected -> ('c, 'd) injected -> ('a, 'b, 'c, 'd) groundi

(** Reifier *)
val reify : (VarEnv.t -> ('a, 'b) injected -> 'b) -> (VarEnv.t -> ('c, 'd) injected -> 'd) -> VarEnv.t -> ('a, 'b, 'c, 'd) groundi -> ('b, 'd) logic
