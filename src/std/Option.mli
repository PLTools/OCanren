(** {2 GT-related API} *)

(** Synonym for regular option type *)
@type 'a t = 'a GT.option with show, gmap, html, eq, compare, foldl, foldr, fmt

(** Ground option (the regular one) *)
@type 'a ground = 'a GT.option with show, gmap, html, eq, compare, foldl, foldr, fmt

(** Logic option *)
@type 'a logic = 'a GT.option Logic.logic with show, gmap, html, eq, compare, foldl, foldr, fmt

(** Logic injection (for reification) *)
val inj : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a ground -> 'b logic

(** A synonym for injected option *)
type 'a injected = 'a ground ilogic

type 'a groundi = 'a injected

(** Make injected [option] from ground one with injected value *)
val option : 'a ilogic ground -> 'a ilogic injected

(** {3 Reifiers} *)

(** Reifier *)
val reify : ('a, 'b) Reifier.t -> ('a injected, 'b logic) Reifier.t

(* Shallow non-variable projection *)
val prj_exn : ('a, 'b) Reifier.t -> ('a injected, 'b ground) Reifier.t

(** {3 Constructors} *)

(** Logic dual of constructor [Some] from {!Stdlib.Option}. *)
val some : 'a -> 'a injected

(** Logic dual of constructor [None] from {!Stdlib.Option}.
    It has an extra unit argument to workaround weak type variables.

    {!Stdlib.Option.t} test *)
val none : unit -> 'a injected
