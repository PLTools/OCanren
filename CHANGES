## 0.4.0 (dev)

### Changed

- Make type 'OCanren.Std.List.ground' to be 'Stdlib.List.t'. It simplifies some injections.
- Minimal GT version is 0.5.2. We fixed few issues there. With old one a few tests may fail.
- The extension `ppx_distrib` should be used as `[%%ocanren_inject ...]` from now on. We also support mutually recursuve types there.
- Wildcards in unification (camlp5 extension)
- Remove dependecy on `base`

## 0.3.0 (28-04-2022)

### Changed
