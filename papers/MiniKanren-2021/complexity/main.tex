\begin{abstract}
  We study the worst-case time complexity of programs in \mK. We propose a model that breaks the evaluation time in \mK into
  several parts and provides methods to estimate the complexity of these different parts. These methods can be combined into an approach for
  analyzing the complexity of recursive relations using the ideas originating from symbolic execution. Our approach puts a number of limitations
  on the program being analyzed but we show that is still practically applicable by applying it to a number of typical relations in \mK.
