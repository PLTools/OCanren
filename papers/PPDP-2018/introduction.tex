\section{Introduction}

Relational programming is a technique, based on the idea of describing programs not as functions, but 
as relations, without distinguishing between arguments and result value. This technique makes it 
possible to ``query'' programs in various ways, for example, to execute them ``backwards'', finding
all sets of arguments for a given result. Relational behavior can be reproduced using a number of
logic programming languages, such as Prolog, Mercury\footnote{\url{https://mercurylang.org}}, 
or Curry\footnote{\url{http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/currywiki}}. 
There is also a family of embedded DSLs, specifically designed for writing declarative relational
programs, which originates from \miniKanren~\cite{TRS}. \miniKanren is a minimalistic 
declarative language, initially developed for Scheme/Racket. The smallest implementation of \miniKanren 
is reported to comprise of only 40 LOC~\cite{MicroKanren,2016}; there are also more elaborate versions, including
\miniKanren with constraints~\cite{CKanren,CKanren1}, user-assisted search~\cite{Guided}, nominal unification~\cite{AlphaKanren},
etc. Due to its simplicity, \miniKanren was implemented for more than 50 other languages, such as
Haskell, Go, Smalltalk, and OCaml.

\miniKanren has proven to be a useful tool to provide elegant solutions for various problems, otherwise considered as
non-trivial~\cite{WillThesis}. One of the most promising areas of application for \miniKanren is the implementation of
\emph{relational interpreters}. Such interpreters are capable not only to interpret programs in various directions, but also
to infer programs on the basis of the expected input-output specification~\cite{Untagged}.

Being quite simple and easy to use by the design, in implementation \miniKanren introduces some subtleties. Under the hood, \miniKanren 
uses a complete interleaving search~\cite{Search}. This search is guaranteed to find all existing solutions; however, it can diverge, when no 
solution exists. In reality, this amounts to a divergence in a number of important cases~--- for example, when a program is asked to 
return \emph{all} existing solutions, or when the number of requested solutions exceeds the number of existing ones. Often, for a 
concrete query, it is possible to refactor the specification to avoid the divergence, but this means, that the specification has to be adjusted for every 
execution ``direction'' of interest, which to some extent compromises the idea of fully declarative relational programming. 

The specifications, which do not diverge even when no solutions exist, are called \emph{refutationally complete}~\cite{WillThesis}. Writing 
refutationally complete relational specifications nowadays requires knowledge of \miniKanren implementation intrinsics, and is not always
possible due to the undecidability of the fundamental computability problems. However, by developing a more advanced search it is possible
to make more specifications refutationally complete.

In this work we address one particular problem, which often leads to refutational incompleteness~--- the non-commutativity of
conjunction. We present an optimization technique, which is based on a certain non-termination test. Our optimization
is \emph{online} (performed during the search), \emph{non-intrusive} (does not introduce new constructs and does not require
any changes to be made to the existing specifications), and \emph{conservative} (applied only when the divergence
is detected). We prove, that for the queries, which return a finite number of answers, our optimization is non-degrading. 
We also demonstrate the application of the optimization for a number of interesting and important problems.
