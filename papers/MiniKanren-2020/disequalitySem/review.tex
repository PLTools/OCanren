\section{The syntax and semantics of the core language}
\label{sec:review}

In this section, we recall existing definitions of the syntax and the two semantics for the core language without disequality constraints and the main result~--- the equivalence
of these two semantics~\cite{CertifiedSemantics}.

\end{array}
\]
\caption{The syntax of core language}
\label{syntax}
\end{figure}

The syntax of the language is shown in Fig.~\ref{syntax}. First, we fix a set of constructors $\mathcal{C}$ with known arities and consider
a set of terms $\mathcal{T}_X$ with constructors as functional symbols and variables from $X$. We parameterize this set with an alphabet of
variables since in the semantic description we will need \emph{two} kinds of variables. The first kind, \emph{syntactic} variables, is denoted
by $\mathcal{X}$. We also consider an alphabet of \emph{relational symbols} $\mathcal{R}$ which are used to name relational definitions.
The central syntactic category in the language is a \emph{goal}. In our case, there are five types of goals: \emph{equality} of terms,
conjunction and disjunction of goals, fresh variable introduction, and invocation of some relational definition. Thus, equality is used
as a constraint, and multiple constraints can be combined using conjunction, disjunction, and recursion. For the sake of brevity we
abbreviate immediately nested ``\lstinline|fresh|'' constructs into the one, writing ``\lstinline|fresh $x$ $y$ $\dots$ . $g$|'' instead of
``\lstinline|fresh $x$ . fresh $y$ . $\dots$ $g$|''. The final syntactic category is \emph{specification} $\mathcal{S}$. It consists of a set
of relational definitions and a top-level goal. A top-level goal represents a search procedure which returns a stream of substitutions for
the free variables of the goal. The language we defined is first-order, as goals can not be passed as parameters,
returned or constructed at runtime.

As an example consider the specification for the standard \lstinline|append$^o$| relation and a query which splits a list containing
three constants \lstinline|A|, \lstinline|B| and \lstinline|C| into two parts in every possible way:

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
  append$^o$ = fun x y xy .
    ((x === Nil) /\ (xy === y)) \/
    (fresh h t ty .
       (x  === Cons (h, t))  /\
       (xy === Cons (h, ty)) /\
       (append$^o$ t y ty)
    );
  append$^o$ x y (Cons (A, Cons (B, Cons (C, Nil))))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Denotational sematics}

For denotational semantics, we use a simple set-theoretic approach which can be considered analogous to the least Herbrand model for definite logic programs~\cite{LHM}.

Intuitively, the mathematical model for every goal should be a relation between semantic variables that occur free in this goal. We represent this relation as a set of total
functions 

\[
\mathfrak{f}:\mathcal{A}\mapsto\mathcal{D}
\]

from semantic variables to ground terms. We call these functions \emph{representing functions}.

Then, the semantic function for goals is parameterized over environments which prescribe semantic functions to relational symbols:

\[
  \Gamma : \mathcal{R} \to (\mathcal{T_A}^*\to 2^{\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{D}})
\]

An environment associates with relational symbol a function that takes a string of terms (the arguments of the relation) and returns a set of
representing functions. The signature for semantic brackets for goals is as follows:

\[
\sembr{\bullet}_{\Gamma} : \mathcal{G}\to 2^{\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{D}}
\]

It maps a goal into the set of representing functions w.r.t. an environment $\Gamma$.

We formulate the following important \emph{completeness condition} for the semantics of a goal $g$: for any goal $g$ and two representing functions ${\mathfrak f}$ and ${\mathfrak f'}$, such that $\left.{\mathfrak f}\right|_{FV(g)} = \left.{\mathfrak f'}\right|_{FV(g)}$
\[ {\mathfrak f} \in \sembr{g} \Leftrightarrow {\mathfrak f'} \in \sembr{g} \]

In other words, representing functions for a goal $g$ restrict only the values of free variables of $g$ and do not introduce any ``hidden'' correlations.
This condition guarantees that our semantics is complete in the sense that it does not introduce artificial restrictions for the relation it defines.
We proved that the semantics of goals always satisfy this condition.

To define the semantic function we need a few operations for representing functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item A homomorphic extension of a representing function 

\[
  \overline{\mathfrak{f}}:\mathcal{T_A}\to\mathcal{D}
\]

which maps terms to terms:

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}

  \overline{\mathfrak f}\,(\alpha) & = & \mathfrak f\,(\alpha)\\
  \overline{\mathfrak f}\,(C_i^{k_i}\,(t_1,\dots.t_{k_i})) & = & C_i^{k_i}\,(\overline{\mathfrak f}\,(t_1),\dots \overline{\mathfrak f}\,(t_{k_i}))
\end{array}
\]

\item A pointwise modification of a function

\[
f\,[x\gets v]\,(z)=\left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
  f\,(z) &,& z \ne x \\
  v      &,& z = x
\end{array}
\right.
\]

\item A \emph{generalization} operation:

\[
\mathfrak{f}\uparrow\alpha = \{ \mathfrak{f}\,[\alpha\gets d] \mid d\in\mathcal D\}
\]

Informally, this operation generalizes a representing function into a set of representing functions in such a way that the
values of these functions for a given variable cover the whole $\mathcal{D}$. We extend the generalization operation for sets of
representing functions $\mathfrak{F}\subseteq\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{D}$:

\[
  \mathfrak{F}\uparrow\alpha = \bigcup_{\mathfrak{f}\in\mathfrak{F}}(\mathfrak{f}\uparrow\alpha)
\]

\end{itemize}

The semantics for goals is shown on Fig.~\ref{denotational_semantics_of_goals}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \[
  \begin{array}{cclr}
    \sembr{t_1\equiv t_2}_\Gamma&=&\{\mathfrak f : \mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{D}\mid \overline{\mathfrak{f}}\,(t_1)=\overline{\mathfrak{f}}\,(t_2)\}& \ruleno{Unify$_D$}\\
    \sembr{g_1\wedge g_2}_\Gamma&=&\sembr{g_1}_\Gamma\cap\sembr{g_1}_\Gamma&\ruleno{Conj$_D$}\\
    \sembr{g_1\vee g_2}_\Gamma&=&\sembr{g_1}_\Gamma\cup\sembr{g_1}_\Gamma&\ruleno{Disj$_D$}\\
    \sembr{\mbox{\lstinline|fresh|}\,x\,.\,g}_\Gamma&=&(\sembr{g\,[\alpha/x]}_\Gamma)\uparrow\alpha,\;\alpha\not\in FV(g)& \ruleno{Fresh$_D$}\\
    \sembr{R\,(t_1,\dots,t_k)}_\Gamma&=&(\Gamma\,R)\,t_1\dots t_k & \ruleno{Invoke$_D$}
  \end{array}
  \]
  \caption{Denotational semantics of goals}
  \label{denotational_semantics_of_goals}
\end{figure}

The final component is the semantics of specifications. Given a specification

\[
\{R_i=\lambda\,x_1^i\dots x_{k_i}^i\,.\,g_i;\}_{i=1}^n\;g
\]

we construct a correct environment $\Gamma_0$ and then take the semantics of the top-level goal:

\[
\sembr{\{R_i=\lambda\,x_1^i\dots x_{k_i}^i\,.\,g_i;\}_{i=1}^n\;g}=\sembr{g}_{\Gamma_0}
\]

As the set of definitions can be mutually recursive we apply the fixed point approach and define $\Gamma_0$ as the least
fixed point of a specific function $F$ that takes an environment $\Gamma$ and returns new environment in which semantics
of a body of each definition is evaluated with environment $\Gamma$.


\subsection{Operational sematics}

The operational semantics of \textsc{miniKanren}, which we described, corresponds to the known
implementations with interleaving search. The semantics is given in the form of a labeled transition system (LTS)~\cite{LTS}.

The states in the transition system have the following shape:

\[
S = \mathcal{G}\times\Sigma\times\mathbb{N}\mid S\oplus S \mid S \otimes \mathcal{G}
\]

A state has a tree-like structure with intermediate nodes corresponding to partially-evaluated conjunctions (``$\otimes$'') or
disjunctions (``$\oplus$''). A leaf in the form $\inbr{g, \sigma, n}$ determines a goal in a context, where $g$~--- a goal, $\sigma$~--- a substitution accumulated so far,
and $n$~--- a natural number, which corresponds to a number of semantic variables used to this point. For a conjunction node, its right child is always a goal since
it cannot be evaluated unless some result is provided by the left conjunct.

We also need extended states

\[
\overline{S} = \diamond \mid S
\]

where $\diamond$ symbolizes the end of the evaluation.

The set of labels is defined as follows:

\[
L = \circ \mid \Sigma\times \mathbb{N}
\]

The label ``$\circ$'' is used to mark those steps which do not provide an answer; otherwise, a transition is labeled by a pair of a substitution and a number of allocated
variables. The substitution is one of the answers, and the number is threaded through the derivation to keep track of the allocated variables.

  \end{array}
  \]
  \caption{Operational semantics of interleaving search}
  \label{lts}
\end{figure*}

The transition rules are shown in Fig.~\ref{lts}. The introduced transition system is completely deterministic.

A derivation sequence for a certain state $s$ determines a \emph{trace} $\tr{s}$~--- a finite or infinite sequence of answers. The trace corresponds to the stream of answers
in the reference \textsc{miniKanren} implementations.

\subsection{Semantics Equivalence}

After we defined two different kinds of semantics for \textsc{miniKanren} we related them and showed that the results given by these two semantics are the same for any specification.
By proving this equivalence we established the \emph{completeness} of the search which means that the search will get all answers satisfying the described specification and only those.

To do it we had to relate the answers produced by these two semantics as they have different forms: a trace of substitutions (along with numbers of allocated variables)
for operational and a set of representing functions for denotational. There is a natural way to extend any substitution to a representing function: composing it with an arbitrary representing function will preserve all variable dependencies in the substitution. So we defined a set of representing functions corresponding to substitution as follows:

\[
\sembr{\sigma} = \{\overline{\mathfrak f} \circ \sigma \mid \mathfrak{f}:\mathcal{A}\mapsto\mathcal{D}\}
\]

And \emph{denotational analog} of an operational semantics (a set of representing functions corresponding to answers in the trace) for given extended state $s$ is
then defined as a union of sets for all substitution in the trace:

\[
\sembr{s}_{op} = \cup_{(\sigma, n) \in \tr{s}} \sembr{\sigma}
\]

This allowed us to state the theorem relating two semantics.

\begin{theorem}[Operational semantics soundness and completeness]
For any specification $\{\dots\}\; g$, for which the indices of all free variables in $g$ are limited by some number $n$

\[
\sembr{\inbr{g, \epsilon, n}}_{op} \eqrestr \sembr{\{\dots\}\; g}.
\]
\end{theorem}

Where `$\eqrestr$' means that we compare representing functions of these sets only on the semantic variables from $\{\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n\}$:

\[
S_1 \eqrestr S_2 \xLeftrightarrow{def}  \{\mathfrak{f}|_{\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\}} \mid \mathfrak{f} \in S_1 \} = \{\mathfrak{f}|_{\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\}} \mid \mathfrak{f} \in S_2 \}.
\]

We can not use the usual equality of sets instead of this one, the sets from the theorem statement are actually not equal.
The reason for this is that denotational semantics encodes only dependencies between the free variables of a goal, which is reflected by the completeness condition, while
operational semantics may also contain dependencies between semantic variables allocated in ``\lstinline|fresh|''.
Therefore we have to restrict representing functions on the semantic variables allocated in the beginning (which includes all free variables of a goal). This does not
compromise our promise to prove the completeness of the search as \textsc{miniKanren} provides the result as substitutions only for queried variables,
which are allocated in the beginning.

The proof of this main theorem was certified in \textsc{Coq}.
