\section{Polymorphic Unification}
\label{sec:unification}

We consider it rather natural to employ polymorphic unification in a language already equipped
with polymorphic comparison~--- a convenient, but somewhat disputable\footnote{See, for example,
\url{https://blogs.janestreet.com/the-perils-of-polymorphic-compare}} feature. Like polymorphic comparison,
polymorphic unification performs a traversal of values, exploiting intrinsic knowledge of their runtime
representation. The undeniable benefits of this solution are, first, that in order to perform unification
for user types no ``boilerplate'' code is needed, and, second, that this approach seems to deliver the
most efficient implementation. On the other hand, all the pitfalls of polymorphic comparison are inherited as
well; in particular, polymorphic unification loops for cyclic data structures and does not work for functional
values. Since we generally do not expect any reasonable outcome in these cases, the only remaining problem is that
the compiler is incapable of providing any assistance in identifying and avoiding these cases. Another drawback is that
the implementation of polymorphic unification relies on the runtime representation of values and has to be fixed
every time the representation changes.  Finally, as it is written in an unsafe manner using the \lstinline{Obj} interface,
it has to be carefully developed and tested.

An important difference between polymorphic comparison and unification is that the former only inspects its operands,
while the results of unification are recorded in a substitution (a mapping from logical variables to terms), which
later is used to reify answers. So, generally speaking, we have to show that no ill-typed
terms are constructed as a result. Overall, this property seems to be maintained vacuously, since the very
nature of (syntactic) unification is to detect whether some things can be considered equal. Nevertheless there are
different type systems and different unification implementations; in addition \emph{equal things} can be
\emph{differently typed}, so we provide here a correctness justification for a well-defined abstract case, and will
reuse this conclusion for various concrete cases.

First, we consider three alphabets:

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
  \tau,\dots&-&\mbox{types}\\
  x^\tau,\dots&-&\mbox{typed logic variables}\\
  C_k^{\tau_1\times\tau_2\times\dots\times\tau_k\to\tau} (k\ge 0),\dots&-&\mbox{typed constructors}
\end{array}
$$

The set of all well-formed typed terms is defined by mutual induction for all types:

$$
t^\tau=x^\tau\mid C_k^{\tau_1\times\tau_2\times\dots\times\tau_k\to\tau}(t^{\tau_1},\,t^{\tau_2},\,\dots,\,t^{\tau_k})
$$

For simplicity from now on we abbreviate the notation $C_k^{\tau_1\times\tau_2\times\dots\times\tau_k\to\tau}(t^{\tau_1},\,t^{\tau_2},\,\dots,\,t^{\tau_k})$ into
$C_k^\tau(t^{\tau_1},\,t^{\tau_2},\,\dots,\,t^{\tau_k})$, keeping in mind that for any concrete constructor and for all its occurrences
in arbitrary terms all its subterms in corresponding positions agree in types.

\begin{comment}
We need also to define the notion of a subterm  $t^\tau[p]$ of a term $t^\tau$ at given position $p$:

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
 p=\epsilon\mid\{1, 2, 3,\dots\}\bullet p&-&\mbox{the set of positions}\\
 t^\tau[\epsilon]=t^\tau&-&\mbox{base case}\\
 C_k^\tau(t_1^{\tau_1},\,t_2^{\tau_2},\dots,\,t_k^{\tau_k})[i\bullet p]=t_i^{\tau_i}[p], 1\le i \le k&-&\mbox{inductive case}
\end{array}
$$
\end{comment}

In this formulation we do not consider any structure over the set of types besides type equality, and we assume all terms are explicitly
attributed by their types at runtime. We employ this property to implement a unification algorithm in regular OCaml, using some
representation for terms and types:

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
    val unify : term -> term -> subst option -> subst option
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent where ``\lstinline{term}'' stands for the type, representing typed terms, ``\lstinline{subst}'' stands for the type of
substitution (a partial mapping from logic variables to terms). Unification can fail (hence ``\lstinline{option}'' in the result type),
is performed in the context of existing substitution (hence ``\lstinline{subst}'' in the third argument) and can be
chained (hence ``\lstinline{option}'' in the third argument).

We use exactly the same unification algorithm with triangular substitution as in the reference implementation~\cite{MicroKanren}. We
omit here some not-so-important details (like ``occurs check'') and refrain from discussing the nature and properties of the algorithm
itself (an excellent description, including a certified correctness proof, can be found in~\cite{Kumar}).

The following snippet presents the implementation:

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true,numbers=left,numberstyle=\small,stepnumber=1,numbersep=-5pt]
    let rec unify $t_1^\tau$ $t_2^\tau$ $subst$ =
      let rec walk $s$ $t^\tau$ =
        match $t^\tau$ with
        | $x^\tau$ when $x^\tau\in dom(s)$ -> $\;\;$walk $s$ $(s\;\;x^\tau)$
        | _ -> $t^\tau$
      in
      match $subst$ with
      | None -> None
      | Some $s$ ->
          match walk $s$ $t_1^\tau$, walk $s$ $t_2^\tau$ with
          | $x_1^\tau$, $x_2^\tau$ when $x_1^\tau$ = $x_2^\tau$ -> $subst$
          | $x_1^\tau$, $q_2^\tau$ -> Some ($s\;[x_1^\tau \gets q_2^\tau]$)
          | $q_1^\tau$, $x_2^\tau$ -> Some ($s\;[x_2^\tau \gets q_1^\tau]$)
          | $C^\tau(t_1^{\tau_1},\dots,t_k^{\tau_k})$, $C^\tau(p_1^{\tau_1},\dots,p_k^{\tau_k})$ ->
              unify $t_k^{\tau_k}$ $p_k^{\tau_k}$(.. (unify $t_1^{\tau_1}$ $p_1^{\tau_1}$ $subst$)$..$)
          | $\_$, $\_$ -> None
\end{lstlisting}

We remind the reader that all superscripts correspond to type attributes, which we consider here as
parts of values being manipulated. For example, line 1 means that we apply \lstinline{unify}
to terms $t_1$ and $t_2$, and expect their types to be equal $\tau$. We assume that
at the top level unification is always applied to some terms of the same type, and that any
substitution can only be acquired from the empty one by a sequence of unifications.

We are going to show that under these assumptions all type attributes are superfluous~--- they
do not affect the execution of \lstinline{unify} and can be removed. Note that the only place where we
were incapable of providing an explicit type attribute was in the line 4, where the result of
substitution application was returned. However, we can prove by induction that any substitution
respects the following property: if a substitution $s$ is defined for a variable $x^\tau$,
then $s\;\;x^\tau$ is attributed with the type $\tau$ (and, consequently, \lstinline{walk $s$ $t^\tau$} always
returns a term of type $\tau$).

Indeed, this property vacuously holds for the empty substitution. Let $s$ be some substitution, for which the
property holds. In the line 11 we return an unchanged substitution; in line 10 we perform two calls~---
\lstinline{walk $s$ $t_1^\tau$} and \lstinline{walk $s$ $t_2^\tau$} and match their results. However,
by our induction hypothesis these results are again attributed by the type $\tau$, which justifies the
pattern matching. In line 11 we return the substitution unchanged, in lines 12 and 13 we extend the
existing substitution, but preserve the property of interest. Finally, in line 15 we chain a few
applications of \lstinline{unify}; note that, again, all these calls are performed for terms of equal
types, starting from a substitution possessing the property of interest. A simple induction on the
chain length completes the proof.

So, type attributes are inessential~--- they are never analyzed and never restrict pattern matching; hence,
they can be erased completely. 
We can notice now that for the representation of terms we can use OCaml's native runtime representation. 
It can not be done, however, using regular OCaml~--- we have to utilize the low-level, unsafe interface \lstinline{Obj}. 
Note also, we need some way to identify the occurrences of logical variables inside the terms (in the original \miniKanren
implementation the ambiguity between variable and non-variable datum representation is resolved by a convention~--- a luxury 
we cannot afford).  We postpone the discussion of this subject until the next section.


%the correctness our of implementation is based on
%the following convention about logical variables: the representation of a logical variable $x^\tau$ must
%correspond to a representation of some value of type $\tau$. This, in turn, makes it somewhat problematic
%to detect a variable occurrence in a term. We postpone the discussion of this subject until Section~\ref{sec:injection}.

We call our implementation \emph{polymorphic}, since at the top level it is defined as

\begin{lstlisting}
   val unify : $\alpha$ -> $\alpha$ -> subst option -> subst option
\end{lstlisting}

The type of substitution is not polymorphic, which means that the compiler completely loses track
of types for values stored in a substitution. These types are recovered later during the reification-of-answers phase (see Section~\ref{sec:reification}).
Outside the unification the compiler maintains typing, which means that all terms, subterms, and variables agree in their types
in all contexts.
