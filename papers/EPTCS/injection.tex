\section{Logic Variables and Injection}
\label{sec:injection}

Unification, considered in Section~\ref{sec:unification}, works for values of any types. However, it
is too generic to be used directly. As long as we use it to unify closed terms, it's ok (but rather meaningless);
however, for terms with free variables the situation becomes more complicated. Indeed, as we've seen in the
previous section, a variable $x^\tau$ must have a runtime representation of some value of type $\tau$. As different
types may not have any values in common, if we wish to unify arbitrary types, we would need to specify the
ground type for each logical variable explicitly, which would throw our implementation into a non-polymorphic
realm with no type inference.

In this part we consider two approaches to safely handling typed terms while preserving polymorphism and
type inference. The first is rather easy to develop and implement; unfortunately, the implementation demonstrates
poor performance for a number of important applications. In order to fix this deficiency, we develop a more
elaborated technique which nevertheless reuses some components from the previous one. In Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}
we present the results of performance evaluation for both approaches and compare them to that of both
implementations.

\subsection{Tagged Logical Values}

The first natural solution is to restrict the unification to logic values only. We introduce the following polymorphic
type $[\alpha]$\footnote{In concrete syntax called ``$\alpha\;$\lstinline{logic}''}, which corresponds to a type, injected into
the logic domain:

\begin{lstlisting}
   type $[\alpha]$ = Var of int | Value of $\alpha$
\end{lstlisting}

Note, this type cannot be disclosed to an end-user, since the only possible way to create a logic variable should
still be by using the ``\lstinline{fresh}'' construct.

Informally speaking, any value of type $[\alpha]$ is either a value of type $\alpha$, or a free
logic variable. Now, we may redefine the signature of abstraction, unification and disequality primitives in the
following manner

\begin{lstlisting}
   val call_fresh : ($[\alpha]$ -> goal) -> goal

   val (===)      : $[\alpha]$ -> $[\alpha]$ -> goal
   val (=/=)      : $[\alpha]$ -> $[\alpha]$ -> goal
\end{lstlisting}

Both unification and disequality constraint would still use the same polymorphic unification; their external, visible type,
however, is restricted to logical types only.

Apart from variables, other logical values can be obtained by injection; conversely, sometimes a logical value can be projected to
a regular one. We supply two basic functions\footnote{In concrete syntax called ``\lstinline{inj}'' and ``\lstinline{prj}''.}
for these purposes

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
   val ($\uparrow_\forall$) : $\alpha$ -> $[\alpha]$
   val ($\downarrow_\forall$) : $[\alpha]$ -> $\alpha$

   let ($\uparrow_\forall$) x = Value x
   let ($\downarrow_\forall$) = function Value x -> x | _ -> failwith $\mbox{``not a value''}$
\end{lstlisting}

which can be used to perform a \emph{shallow} injection/projection. As expected, the injection is total, while the projection is partial.
Using these functions and type-specific functors, which can be derived automatically using a number of existing frameworks for
generic programming, one can easily provide injection and projection for user-defined datatypes.

We consider a user-defined list type as an example:

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
   type ($\alpha$, $\beta$) list$_f$ = Nil | Cons of $\alpha$ * $\beta$

   type $\alpha$ list = ($\alpha$, $\alpha$ list) list$_f$
   type $\alpha$ list$_l$ = $[$($[\alpha]$, $\alpha$ list$_l$) list$]$

   let rec $\uparrow_{\mbox{\texttt{list}}}$ l = $\uparrow$($fmap_{\mbox{\texttt{list}}_f}$ ($\uparrow_\forall$) $\uparrow_{\mbox{\texttt{list}}}$ l)
   let rec $\downarrow_{\mbox{\texttt{list}}}$ l = $fmap_{\mbox{\texttt{list}}_f}$ ($\downarrow_\forall$) $\downarrow_{\mbox{\texttt{list}}}$ ($\downarrow_\forall$ l)
\end{lstlisting}

Here ``\lstinline{list$_f$}'' is a custom functor for lists. We provide two specialized versions~--- ``\lstinline{list}'',
which corresponds to regular, non-logic lists, and ``\lstinline{list}$_l$'', which corresponds to logical lists with logical elements.
Using a single type-specific function \lstinline{$fmap_{\mbox{\texttt{list}}_f}$}, we easily build both an injection of type

\begin{lstlisting}
   $\alpha$ list -> $\alpha$ list$_l$
\end{lstlisting}

and a projection of type

\begin{lstlisting}
   $\alpha$ list$_l$ -> $\alpha$ list
\end{lstlisting}

Generally speaking, we can always implement injection/projection for an arbitrary regular type, represented as a fixpoint of a functor~\cite{ALaCarte},
using only $\uparrow_\forall$, $\downarrow_\forall$ and a small set of datatype-generic combinators.

We now can address the problem of variable identification during polymorphic unification. As we do not know the types, we cannot discriminate logical
variables by their tags only and, thus, cannot simply use pattern matching. In our implementation we perform a variable test
as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item in an environment, we additionally keep some unique boxed value~--- \emph{anchor}~--- created by \lstinline{run} at the moment of initial
state generation; the anchor is inherited unchanged in all derived environments during the search session;
\item in each variable we additionally save the anchor, inherited from the environment, in which the variable was created;
\item inside a unification, in order to check if we are dealing with a variable, we test the conjunction of the following properties:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the scrutinee is boxed;
    \item the scrutinee's tag and layout correspond to those for variables;
    \item the scrutinee's anchor and the current environment's anchor have equal addresses.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Taking into account that the state type is abstract at the user level, we guarantee that only those variables which were
created during the current run session would pass the test, since the pointer to the anchor is unique among all pointers to a boxed value
and could not be disclosed anywhere but in the variable-creation primitive.

The only thing to describe now is the implementation of the refinement stage. The refinement is represented by the following
function:

\begin{lstlisting}
   val refine : state -> $[\alpha]$ -> $[\alpha]$
\end{lstlisting}

This function takes a state and a logical value and recursively substitutes all logical variables in that value w.r.t.
the substitution in the state until no occurrences of bound variables are left. Since in our implementation the type of a substitution is
not polymorphic, \lstinline{refine} is also implemented in an unsafe manner. However, it is easy to see that \lstinline{refine}
does not produce ill-typed terms. Indeed, all original types of variables are preserved in a substitution; unification does not
change unified terms, so all terms bound in a substitution are well-typed. Hence, \lstinline{refine} always substitutes
some subterm in a well-typed term with another term of the same type, which preserves well-typedness.

In addition to performing substitutions, \lstinline{refine} also reifies disequality constraints. Reification
attaches to each free variable in a refined term a list of refined terms, describing the disequality constraints for that
free variable. Note, disequality can be established only for equally-typed terms, which justifies type-safety of reification.
Note also, additional care has to be taken to avoid infinite looping, since refinement and reification are
mutually recursive, and refinement of a variable can be potentially invoked from itself due to a chain of disequality
constraints.

After refinement, the content of a logical value can be inspected via the following function:

\begin{lstlisting}
   val destruct : $[\alpha]$ -> [`Var of int * $[\alpha]$ list | `Value of $\alpha$]
\end{lstlisting}

Constructor \lstinline{`Var} corresponds to a free variable with unique integer identifier and a list of terms,
representing all disequality constraints for this variable. These terms are refined as well.

\subsection{Tagless Logical Values and Type Bookkeeping}

The solution presented in the previous subsection suffers from the following deficiency: in order to perform unification,
we inject terms into the logic domain, making them as twice as large. As a result, this implementation loses to the original one in
terms of performance in many important applications, which compromises the very idea of using OCaml as a host language.

Here we develop an advanced version, which eliminates this penalty. As a first step, let's try to eliminate the tagging with
a drastic measure:

\begin{lstlisting}
   type $[\alpha]$ = $\alpha$
\end{lstlisting}

What consequences would this have? Of course, we would not be able to create logical variables in a conventional way. However,
we still could have a separate type for variables

\begin{lstlisting}
   type var = Var of int * anchor
\end{lstlisting}

and use \emph{the same} variable test procedure. As the type $[\alpha]$ is abstract, this modification does not change the interface.
As we reuse the variable test, polymorphic unification can continue to work \emph{almost} correctly. The problem is that
now it can introduce the occurrences of free logic variables in non-logical, tagless, data structures. These free logic variables
do not get in the way of unification itself (since it can handle them properly, thanks to the variable test), but they can not
be disclosed to the outer world as is.

Our idea is to use this generally unsound representation for all internal actions, and perform tagging only during the refinement
stage. However, this scenario raises the following question: what would the type of \lstinline{refine} be? It can not be simply

\begin{lstlisting}
   val refine : state -> $[\alpha]$ -> $[\alpha]$
\end{lstlisting}

anymore since $[\alpha]$ now equals $\alpha$. We \emph{want}, however, it be something like

\begin{lstlisting}
   val refine : state -> $[\alpha]$ -> $(\mbox{``tagged'' }[\alpha])$
\end{lstlisting}

If $\alpha$ is not a parametric type, we can simply test if the value is a variable, and if yes, tag it with constructor \lstinline{Var};
otherwise we tag it with \lstinline{Value}, and we're done. This trick, however, would not work for parametric types. Consider, for example,
the refinement of a value of type \lstinline{$[[$int$]$ list$]$}. The (hypothetical) approach being described would return a value of
type \lstinline{$(\mbox{``tagged'' }[[$int$]$ list$])$}, i.e. tagged only on the top level; we need to repeat the procedure
recursively. In other words, we need the following (meta) type for the refinement primitive:

\begin{lstlisting}
   val refine : state -> $[\alpha]$ -> $\mbox{(``tagged''} [\beta])$
\end{lstlisting}

where $\beta$ is the result of tagging $\alpha$.

These considerations can be boiled down to the following concrete implementation.

First, we roll back to the initial definition of $[\alpha]$~--- it will play role of our ``tagged'' type.
We introduce a new, two-parameter type\footnote{In concrete syntax called ``$(\alpha,\;\beta)\;$\lstinline{injected}''.}

\begin{lstlisting}
   type $\{\alpha,\;\beta\}$ = $\alpha$
\end{lstlisting}

Of course, this type is kept abstract at the end-user level. Informally speaking, type $\{\alpha,\;\beta\}$ designates the
injection of tagless type $\alpha$ into tagged type $\beta$; the value itself is kept in the tagless form, but
tagged type can be used during the refinement stage as a constraint, which would allow us to a refine tagless
representation only to a feasible tagged one.

We introduce the following primitives for the type $\{\alpha,\;\beta\}$:

\begin{lstlisting}
   val lift : $\alpha$ -> $\{\alpha,\;\alpha\}$
   val inj  : $\{\alpha,\;\beta\}$ -> $\{\alpha,\;[\beta]\}$

   let lift x = x
   let inj  x = x
\end{lstlisting}

The function \lstinline{lift} puts a value into the ``bookkeeping injection'' domain for the first time, while
\lstinline{inj} plays the role of injection itself. Their composition is analogous to what was
called ``$\uparrow_\forall$'' in the previous implementation:

\begin{lstlisting}
   val $\uparrow_\forall$ : $\alpha$ -> $\{\alpha,\;[\alpha]\}$
   let $\uparrow_\forall$ x = lift x |> inj
\end{lstlisting}

In order to deal with parametric types, we can again utilize generic programming. To handle the types with
one parameter, we introduce the following functor:

\begin{lstlisting}
   module FMap (T : sig type $\alpha$ t val fmap : ($\alpha$ -> $\beta$) -> $\alpha$ t -> $\beta$ t end) :
     sig
       val distrib : $\{\alpha,\;\beta\}$ T.t -> $\{\alpha$ T.t, $\beta$ T.t$\}$
     end =
     struct
       let distrib x = x
     end
\end{lstlisting}

Note, that we do not use the function ``\lstinline{T.fmap}'' in the implementation; however, first, we need an inhabitant of the
corresponding type to make sure we are indeed dealing with a functor, and next, we actually will use it in the
implementation of type-specific refinement, see below).

In order to handle two-, three-, etc. parameter types we need higher-kinded polymorphism, which is
not supported in a direct form in OCaml. So, unfortunately, we need to introduce separate
functors for the types with two-, three- etc. parameters; existing works on higher-kinded
polymorphism in OCaml~\cite{HKinded} require the similar scaffolding to be erected as a bootstrap step.

Given the functor(s) of the described shape, we can use it in the following manner:

\begin{lstlisting}
   module FOption = FMap
     (struct
        type $\alpha$ t = $\alpha$ option
        let fmap = $fmap_{\mbox{\texttt{option}}}$
      end
     )

   val some : $\{\alpha, \beta\}$ -> $\{\alpha\mbox{\texttt{ option}},\;\beta\mbox{\texttt{ option}}\}$
   val none : unit  -> $\{\alpha\mbox{\texttt{ option}},\;\beta\mbox{\texttt{ option}}\}$

   let some x  = FOption.distrib (Some x) |> inj
   let none () = FOption.distrib None     |> inj
\end{lstlisting}

In other words, we can in a very systematic manner define \emph{logic representatives} for all constructors
of types of interest. These representatives can be used in the relational code, providing a well-bookkept
typing~--- for each logical type we would be able to reconstruct its original, tagless preimage.

With the new implementation, the types for ``basic'' goal constructors have to be adjusted:

\begin{lstlisting}
   val (===) : $\{\alpha,\;[\beta]\}$ -> $\{\alpha,\;[\beta]\}$ -> goal
   val (=/=) : $\{\alpha,\;[\beta]\}$ -> $\{\alpha,\;[\beta]\}$ -> goal
\end{lstlisting}

As always, we require both arguments of unification and disequality constraint to be of the same type; in addition
we require the ``injected'' part of the type to be logical.

During the refinement stage the bindings for ``interesting'' variables, reconstructed using the final
substitution, have to be properly tagged. This process as well is implemented in a datatype-generic manner:
first, we have refiners for primitive types:

\begin{lstlisting}
   val refine$_{\mbox{\texttt{int}}}$ : helper -> $\{$int,$[$int$]\}$ -> $[$int$]$
   val refine$_{\mbox{\texttt{string}}}$ : helper -> $\{$string,$[$string$]\}$ -> $[$string$]$
   ...
\end{lstlisting}

and, then, we add the refiner to the output signature in all \lstinline{FMap}-like functors:

\begin{lstlisting}
   val refine: (helper -> $\{\alpha,\;\beta\}$ -> $\beta$) -> helper -> $\{\alpha$ T.t, $[\beta$ T.t$]$ as $\gamma\}$ -> $\gamma$
\end{lstlisting}

Note, since now \lstinline{refine} is type-specific and, hence, constructed at the user-level, we refrain from passing
it a state (which is inaccessible on the user level). Instead, we wrap all state-specific functionality in
abstract \lstinline{helper} data type, which encapsulates all state-dependent functionality needed for \lstinline{refine}
to work properly.
