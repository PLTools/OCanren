\section{Reification and Top-Level Primitives}
\label{sec:reification}

In Section~\ref{sec:goals} we presented a top-level function \lstinline{run}, which
runs a goal and returns a stream of states. To acquire answers for the query, 
represented by that goal, its free variables have to be reified in these states, and
we described the reification primitives in Section~\ref{sec:injection}. However, 
the states keep answers in an untyped form, and the types of answers are
recovered solely on the basis of the types of variables being reified. So, the 
type safety of the reification critically depends on the requirement to
reify each variable only in those states, which are descendants (w.r.t. the search tree)
of the state, in which that variable was created. In this section we describe a set of
top-level primitives, which enforce this requirement.

We provide a set of top-level combinators, which should be used to surround relational code
and perform reification in a transparent manner only in correct states.
We reimplement the top-level primitive \lstinline{run} to take three
arguments. The exact type of \lstinline{run} is rather complex and non-instructive,
so we prefer to describe the typical form of its application:

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
   run $\overline{n}$ (fun $l_1\dots l_n$ -> $\;\;G$) (fun $a_1\dots a_n$ -> $\;\;H$)
\end{lstlisting}

Here $\overline{n}$ stands for a \emph{numeral}, which describes the number of
parameters for two other arguments of \lstinline{run}, \mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$}~---
free logical variables, $G$~--- a goal (which can make use of \mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$}),
\mbox{$a_1\dots a_n$}~--- reified answers for \mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$}, respectively, and,
finally, $H$~--- a \emph{handler} (which can make use of \mbox{$a_1\dots a_n$}).

The types of \mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$} are inferred from $G$ and always have a form

\begin{lstlisting}
   $\{\alpha,\;[\beta]\}$
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent since the types of variables can be constrained only in unification or disequality constraints.

The types of \mbox{$a_1\dots a_n$} are inferred from the types of \mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$} and
have the form

\begin{lstlisting}
   $(\alpha,\;\beta)$ reified stream
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent where the type \lstinline{reified}, in turn, is

\begin{lstlisting}
   type ($\alpha$, $\beta$) reified = $<\;$prj : $\alpha$; reify : (helper -> $\{\alpha,\;\beta\}$ -> $\beta$) -> $\beta>$
\end{lstlisting}

Two methods of this type can be used to perform two different styles of reification: first, a value without
free variables can be returned as is (using the method \lstinline{prj} which checks that in the value of
interest no free variables occur, and raises an exception otherwise). If the value contains some free
variables, it has to be properly injected into the logic domain~--- this is what \lstinline{reify} stands
for. It takes as an argument a type-specific tagging function, constructed using generic
primitives described in the previous section.

In other words a user-defined handler takes streams of reified answers for all variables supplied to the top-level
goal. All streams $a_i$ contain coherent elements, so they all have the same length and $n$-th elements of all
streams correspond to the $n$-th answer, produced by the goal $G$.

There are a few predefined numerals for one, two, etc. arguments (called, traditionally,
\lstinline{q}, \lstinline{qr}, \lstinline{qrs} etc.), and a successor function, which
can be applied to existing numeral to increment the number of expected arguments. The
implementation technique generally follows~\cite{Unparsing, DoWeNeed}.

Thus, the search and reification are tightly coupled; it is simply impossible to perform the reification 
for arbitrary taken state and variable. This solution both guarantees the type safety and frees an end
user from the necessity to call reification primitives manually.
