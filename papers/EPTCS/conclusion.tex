\section{Conclusion}

We presented a strongly-typed implementation of \miniKanren for OCaml. Our implementation
passes all tests written for \miniKanren (including those for disequality constraints);
in addition we implemented many interesting relational programs known from
the literature. We claim that our implementation can be used both as a convenient
relational DSL for OCaml and an experimental framework for future research in the area of
relational programming.

%We also want to express our gratitude to William Byrd, who infected us with relational programming,
%and for the extra time he sacrificed as both our tutor and friend.
