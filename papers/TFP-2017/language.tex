\section{The Source Language and Relational Extension}

Our development of relational conversion is based on the idea of transforming a program in a functional
language into a program in \emph{relational extension} of that language. In the context of 
miniKanren this approach looks quite natural since miniKanren itself, as a DSL, reuses 
many important features (for example, function definitions) from a host language.

In this section, we present a formal description of a small functional language, taken as a source
for relational conversion. We describe its syntax, typing rules, and semantics, and then extend it
with relational constructs. We specify the typing rules and semantics for the extension as well.


\subsection{The Source Language}
\label{source_language}

The syntax of our source functional language is shown on Figure~\ref{functional_syntax}. It consists of a lambda calculus, 
enriched with constructors with fixed arities $C^n$, patterns $p$ and pattern-matching constructs, and  
expressions for recursive/non-recursive let-bindings.
Among then constructors we distinguish two nullary interpreted constructors \lstinline|true| and \lstinline|false|, and add a boolean equality
operator ``$=$''.

     & &\lstinline|match $e$ with $\{p_i$ -> $e_i\}$|\\
     & &\\
 \mathcal P &=&C^n(x_1,\dots,x_n)\\
\end{array}
$$

\end{wrapfigure}

In a pattern matching, we only allow shallow patterns (which is not an essential limitation) and do not allow wildcards (which is 
important~--- converting wildcard pattern matching into relational form would require essentially different projections). 
This choice of a language may 
look quite a restrictive. However, in terms of relational programming, the language contains virtually everything one would need. Indeed, from
a relational conversion standpoint the standard built-in integer arithmetics, for example, is of no use~--- 
there is simply no way to convert integer expression into relational form, using integer expressions. In order to use relational 
arithmetics, one needs to reimplement everything from scratch, using, for example, Peano encoding; but Peano arithmetics can be
easily expressed in the language we present.

Our language is equipped with Hindley-Milner type system, and we present the typing rules in a conventional syntax-directed form 
on Figure~\ref{functional_typing}. Besides type variables and function types our system contains a number of implicitly defined 
algebraic datatypes $T^k$, and we stipulate, that each constructor $C^n$ belongs to the exactly one
datatype. In the rule \textsc{Constr$_T$} we assume, that type $t^C$ has the form $T^k(t_1,\dots,t_k)$, where each of the types
$t_i$ is recovered from the types $t_i^C$ of arguments of constructor $C^n$ and, moreover, these types are agree in the sense of
constructor application. Similarly, in the rule \textsc{Match$_T$} the types of all $C_i^{k_i}(x^i_1,\dots,x^i_{k_i})$ are expected
to be equal $t^C$, and $t^{C_i}_j$ is a type of $j$-th argument of constructor $C_i$, used in the pattern. The rule \textsc{Eq$_T$}
specifies, that both operands of equality operator must have the same (but arbitrary) type. Thus, we can call this operator
``polymorphic equality''.

We describe the semantics of our language in the form of transition system. The transition relation

$$
\step{\mathcal S,\,e}{\mathcal S^\prime,\,e^\prime}
$$

\noindent describes a one step of evaluation of expression $e$ with a stack of contexts $\mathcal S$, which results in
a new stack $\mathcal S^\prime$ and a new expression $e^\prime$. A context is an expression with a unique hole; informally speaking, 
a stack of contexts describes a path in the expression being evaluated from the topmost construct to the point, where the evaluation 
currently is taking place. For a context $C$ and an expression $e$ we denote by $C[e]$ a complete expression with no holes, which is 
obtained by plugging $e$ into the unique hole of $C$. From each state $\inbr{C_1:C_2:\dots:C_k,e}$ we can build an 
expression $C_k[\dots[C_2[C_1[e]]]\dots]$, which represents an intermediate result of evaluation according to a small-step semantics. 
This form of semantic description originates from Felleisen-style~\cite{Felleisen} approach for small-step semantics, and we've
chosen it since it can be naturally extended for a relational case.

Our semantics describes call-by-value left-to-right evaluation; in the rules $\textsc{Beta}$, $\textsc{Mu}$, $\textsc{LetVal}$,
$\textsc{LetRec}$ and $\textsc{MatchVal}$ we perform capture-avoiding substitutions, which respect the names in abstractions and let-bindings.
In the rule $\textsc{MatchVal}$ we assume, that at most one pattern matches the scrutinee~--- this is an important difference from the usual 
semantics of pattern matching, when the patterns are examined in a top-down manner until the match succeeds. In the rules $\textsc{EqTrue}$
and $\textsc{EqFalse}$ we assume, that the values $v$, $v_1$, $v_2$ do not have the forms $\lambda x\dots$ or $\mu f\dots$.

Finally, for a closed expression $e$ and a value $v$ we write $e \leadsto^f v$, iff 

$$\inbr{\epsilon,e}\to^*\inbr{\epsilon,v}$$

\noindent where $\epsilon$~--- an empty stack, and ``$\to^*$'' is a reflexive-transitive closure of ``$\to$''. 


\subsection{Relational Extension}
\label{relational_extension}

The relational extension adds five conventional miniKanren expressions for constructing goals; the syntax is shown on Figure~\ref{relational_syntax}.
Since relational constructs are added to regular functional ones, it becomes possible to construct expressions like \lstinline|fun x.(x /\ fun y.y)|, etc.
In order to rule such pathological expressions out we devised an extension for the type system of the source language. In fact, this approach follows the
actual implementation for OCaml, where a careful choice of types for representing terms and goals made it possible to reject the majority of non-well-formed
programs at compile-time.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
\centering
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\mathcal E\mathrel{{+}{=}}&\lstinline|fresh ($x$) $\;e$|\\
                    &e_1\equiv e_2\\
                    &e_1\not\equiv e_2\\
                    &e_1\vee e_2\\
                    &e_1\wedge e_2
\end{array}
$$
\caption{The syntax of relational extension}
\label{relational_syntax}
\end{wrapfigure}

Our extension for the type system introduces one interpreted datatype constructor $\Box^o$ with one data constructor $\uparrow$~--- a polymorphic type and
a constructor for logical terms. In addition, we introduce an interpreted type of goals $\G$, which is distinct from all other types. The typing rules for the relational 
extension are shown on Figure~\ref{relational_typing}. These rules describe rather expected typing: in unification and disequality constraints only
terms of the same logical type can be used, and conjunction and disjunction can only be taken for goals. Note, in our extension a term can be calculated as
a result of arbitrary expression in initial functional language (as long as this expression has expected logical type), but such ``higher-order'' terms will
never appear as a result of relational conversion, so, in fact, relational extension we describe here defines a richer language, than we actually need.

The semantics of extended language is shown on Figure~\ref{relational_semantics}. First, the state is extended: besides the stack of contexts and
current expression it now contains a set of used \emph{semantic variables} $\Sigma$ and a \emph{logical state} $\sigma$. 
Semantic variables are allocated and substituted for syntactic logic variable occurrences when \lstinline|fresh| expression is evaluated 
(see rule \textsc{Fresh}). Logical states are affected when unification or disequality constraint is evaluated; we explain them
in details below. All existing rules for the initial language are considered rewritten to propagate newly added components of states unchanged.
Then, we modify the substitution to respect names, bounded in \lstinline|fresh| as well. 
Next, we consider two new kinds of values: a semantic variable and a special value \lstinline|success|. The former is a result of evaluation for
a free logic variable, the latter~--- the result of evaluation for a succeeded goal.

We also extend the definition of context to handle new kinds of expressions. In unification and disequality constraint, the terms are evaluated left-to-right.
Conjunction and disjunction, however, evaluate nondeterministically: in disjunction only one subgoal is chosen (see rules \textsc{DisjL} and \textsc{DisjR}),
a conjunction can evaluate either left, or right subgoal first (see rules \textsc{ConjStartL} and \textsc{ConjStartR}). When chosen subgoal is evaluated
to the value \lstinline|success|, the other subgoal starts its evaluation (rules \textsc{ConjL} and \textsc{ConjR}).
We have chosen a nondeterministic variant for the semantics since different existing miniKanren implementations use (a little bit) different search, and we do 
not want to depend on implementation details. An opposite side of this solution is that for a concrete program and a concrete miniKanren implementation,
the result of evaluation might not coincide with that, prescribed by the semantics: in concrete implementation a program can diverge, while
nondeterministic semantics may still define a certain scenario to complete with a result. We argue, that in this case, it will always be possible to
rewrite a program or/and interpreter to converge according to that scenario.

\caption{Semantics for the relational extension}
\label{relational_semantics}
\end{figure}

Finally, we describe the structure of a logical state and the implementation of unification and disequality constraint. The development is mainly based on the existing implementation~\cite{CKanren} and standard approaches for implementing unification~\cite{Unification,UnificationRevisited}. We, therefore, assume the familiarity of the reader with the following notions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item substitution ($\theta$);
  \item application of substitution $\theta$ to a term $t$ ($t\,\theta$);
  \item composition of substitutions ($\theta\theta^\prime$);
  \item most general unifier of two terms ($mgu\,(t_1, t_2)$).
\end{itemize}
 
As it can be seen from the semantics and typing rules, a unification (or disequality constraint) can only
be applied to equally-typed logical values, and we consider substitutions to be partial functions from
semantic variables ($\mathfrak S$) to logical values.

Before giving the detailed description, we consider the following example, which is called to reveal the essence of unification and
disequality constraint coexistence. Note, only these two kinds of goals deliver new information~--- all other kinds (conjunction, disjunction, etc.) are rather needed to
put them in a right context or order. Let us have the following sequence of goals, which we have to evaluate one after another (we assume all logical 
variables are already properly allocated):

$$
\def\arraystretch{1}
\begin{array}{rcl}
x&\not\equiv&y\\
z&\not\equiv&y\\
y&\equiv&\lstinline|A|\\
x&\equiv&\lstinline|B|\\
z&\equiv&\lstinline|A|
\end{array}
$$

Since we know nothing, we are unable to determine, if the first goal~--- \mbox{$x\not\equiv y$}~--- succeeds or fails right now. All we can do is to
remember the substitution \mbox{$[x\binds y]$} with the note, that we \emph{do not want} to allow it. We call this kind of substitutions \emph{negative}. Similarly,
after the next goal we have another negative substitution \mbox{$[z\binds y]$}. 

The next goal is the unification \mbox{$y\equiv\lstinline|A|$}. Obviously, it provides us with the substitution \mbox{$[y\binds\lstinline|A|]$}. What effect (if any)
should it have on the set of negative substitutions? Since the unification completely eliminates the variable $y$, replacing negative substitutions with
\mbox{$[x\binds\lstinline|A|]$}, \mbox{$[z\binds\lstinline|A|]$} looks reasonable.

The next goal is \mbox{$x\equiv\lstinline|B|$}. It extends the current substitution, making it \mbox{$[y\binds\lstinline|A|,\,x\binds\lstinline|B|]$}. Now we may
note, that since $x$ already became \lstinline|B|, it can never be \lstinline|A| anymore. Thus, we can drop \mbox{$[x\binds\lstinline|A|]$} from the set of
negative substitutions.

Finally, we unify $z$ with \lstinline|A|. This, however, gets us a substitution \mbox{$[z\binds\lstinline|A|]$}, which we have to disallow since it
matches with the negative one.

In other words, disequality constraints may not succeed or fail right away, and the results of unification have to be additionally matched against the set of 
previously encountered disequality constraints, which, in turn, can be altered by a unification or another disequality constraint. Now we can continue.

A logical state contains two components

$$
\sigma=(\theta,\Theta^-)
$$

\noindent where $\theta$ is a substitution, $\Theta^-$~--- a set of negative substitutions describing disequality constraints, 
which can potentially be violated. The initial state contains undefined substitution and empty set:

$$
\iota=(\bot,\emptyset)
$$

The effect of unification is described by the following primitive:

$$
{\bf unify}\,(\sigma,\,t_1,\,t_2)={\bf unify}\,((\theta,\Theta^-),\,t_1,\,t_2)
$$

First, it calculates the most general unifier for the terms under consideration w.r.t. current substitution:

$$
\rho=mgu\,(t_1\,\theta,t_2\,\theta)
$$

If there is no such $\rho$ the unification fails, and the evaluation terminates unsuccessfully. Otherwise,
$\rho$ has to be checked against the disequality constraints, represented by $\Theta^-$ (if $\Theta^-$ is empty, the
check succeeds immediately).

Being a substitution, $\rho$ at the same time can be considered as the following unification problem: we can try to unify a pair of terms 

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
t_l&=&(\mathfrak s_1,\dots,\mathfrak s_k)\\
t_r&=&(\rho(\mathfrak s_1),\dots,\rho(\mathfrak s_k))
\end{array}
$$

\noindent where $\{\mathfrak s_i\}=dom\,(\rho)$. We pick every substitution $\theta^-\in\Theta^-$ and calculate 
the $mgu\,(t_l\,\theta^-,t_r\,\theta^-)$. There are three possible outcomes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The unification fails. This means, that disequality constraint, represented by $\theta^-$, can no
longer be violated. We remove $\theta^-$ from $\Theta^-$ and continue with the next disequality constraint.
\item The unification succeeds with the empty substitution. This means, that 
disequality constraint, represented by $\theta^-$, is violated. The check stops, and the whole top-level 
unification fails.
\item The unification succeeds with a non-empty substitution $\theta^{\prime-}$. This means, that in order not to 
violate disequality constraint, represented by $\theta^-$, $\theta^{\prime-}$ has to be respected. We replace
$\theta^-$ with $\theta^{\prime-}$ in $\Theta^-$ and continue with the next disequality constraint.
\end{enumerate}

If the disequality check succeeds, by the end we have a modified set $\Theta^{\prime-}$, and we assume

$$
{\bf unify}\,((\theta,\Theta^-),\,t_1,\,t_2)=(\theta\rho,\Theta^{\prime-})
$$

The evaluation of disequality constraint is performed in a similar manner using the primitive

$$
{\bf diseq}\,(\sigma,\,t_1,\,t_2)={\bf diseq}\,((\theta,\Theta^-),\,t_1,\,t_2)
$$

First, the $mgu\,(t_1\,\theta,t_2\,\theta)$ is calculated. Again, there are three
possible cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The unification fails. This means, that disequality constraint is satisfied.
\item The unification succeeds with the empty substitution. This means, that disequality
constraint is violated.
\item The unification succeeds with a non-empty substitution $\theta^{\prime-}$. This means, that 
this substitution describes the disequality constraint, which has to be respected in
the future, so we add it to $\Theta^-$. 
\end{enumerate}

If disequality constraint succeeds, we obtain a (potentially) modified set $\Theta^{\prime-}$, and we
assume

$$
{\bf diseq}\,((\theta,\Theta^-),\,t_1,\,t_2)=(\theta,\Theta^{\prime-})
$$

Finally, for a closed goal $g$ and a logical state $\sigma$ we define $g \leadsto^r \sigma$, iff

$$
\inbr{\emptyset,\epsilon,g,\iota}\leadsto^*\inbr{\Sigma,\epsilon,\lstinline|success|,\sigma}\mbox{ for some $\Sigma$}
$$
 
\noindent where ``$\leadsto^*$'' is a reflexive-transitive closure of ``$\leadsto$''. 

One may notice, that the typing rules for the relational extension add nothing more than some
interpreted types and symbols w.r.t. the type system of the substrate language. Thus, it 
is rather expected, that the relational extension inherits all its useful properties (like progress and
type preservation). Surprisingly, this is not completely so. Indeed, the only value for goals is
\lstinline|success|, but, obviously, not every goal succeeds (for example, \lstinline|A === B| always
fails). Thus, our relational extension lacks the progress property~--- a decently typed non-value
goal sometimes cannot make a step. This makes no harm in the context of the paper; in any case,
a failure value for goals can be added to the language together with the failure propagation rules.
