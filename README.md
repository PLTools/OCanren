# OCanren

OCanren is a strongly-typed embedding of [miniKanren](http://minikanren.org) relational 
programming language into [Objective Caml] (http://ocaml.org). More precisely, OCanren
implements [microKanren](http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf) 
with [disequality constraints] (http://scheme2011.ucombinator.org/papers/Alvis2011.pdf).

The correspondence between original MiniKanren and OCanren constructs is shown below:

| miniKanren                        | OCanren                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------|
| `#u`                              | success                                         |
| `#f`                              | failure                                         |
| `((==) a b)`                      | `(a === b)`                                     |
| `((=/=) a b)`                     | `(a =/= b)`                                     |
| `(conde (a b ...) (c d ...) ...)` | `conde [a &&& b &&& ...; c &&& d &&& ...; ...]` |
| `(fresh (x y ...) a b ...      )` | `fresh (x y ...) a b ...`                       |

In addition, OCanren introduces explicit disjunction (`|||`) and conjunction
(`&&&`) operators for goals.

## Injecting and Projecting User-Type Data

To make it possible to work with OCanren, user-type data have to be *injected* into
logic domain. In the simplest case (non-parametric, non-recursive) the function

```ocaml
inj : 'a -> 'a logic
```

can be used for this purpose:

```ocaml
inj 1
```

```ocaml
inj true
```

```ocaml
inj "abc"
```

There is also a prefix synonym `!!` for `inj`.

If the type is parametric (but non-recursive), then (as a rule) all its type parameters
have to be injected as well:

```ocaml
!! (gmap(option) (!!) (Some x))
```

```ocaml
!! (gmap(pair) (!!) (!!) (x, y))
```
 
Here `gmap(type)` is a type-indexed morphism for the type `type`; it can be written
by hands, or constructed using one of the existing generic programming 
frameworks (the library itself uses [GT](https://github.com/dboulytchev/generic-transformers)).

If the type is recursive, then, as a rule, it has to be abstracted from itself, and then
injected as in the previous case, for example,

```ocaml
type tree = Leaf | Node of tree * tree
```

is converted into

```ocaml
type 'self tree = Leaf | Node of 'self * 'self

let rec inj_tree t = !! (gmap(tree) inj_tree t)
```

Pragmatically speaking, it is desirable to make a type fully abstract, thus
logic variables can be placed in arbitrary position, for example, 

```ocaml
type ('a, 'b, 'self) tree = Leaf of 'a | Node of 'b * 'self * 'self

let rec inj_tree t = !! (gmap(tree) (!!) (!!) inj_tree t)

```

instead of

```ocaml
type tree = Leaf of int | Node of string * t * t
```

Symmetrically, there is a projection function `prj` (and a prefix
synonym `!?`), which can be used to project logical values into
regular ones. Note, that this function is partial, and can
raise `Not_a_value` exception. There is failure-continuation-passing
version of `prj`, which can be used to react on this situation. See
autogenerated documentation for details.

## Bool, Nat, List

There is some built-in support for a few basic types --- booleans, natural
numbers in Peano form, logical lists. See corresponding modules.

The following table summarizes the correspondence between some expressions
on regular lists and their OCanren counterparts:


| Regular lists   | OCanren              |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `[]`            | `nil`                |
| `[x]`           | `!< x`               |
| `[x; y]`        | `x %< y`             |
| `[x; y; z]`     | `x % (y %< z)`       |
| `x::y::z::tl`   | `x % (y % (z % tl))` |
| `x::xs`         | `x % xs`             |

## Syntax Extensions

There are two constructs, implemented as syntax extensions: `fresh` and `defer`. The latter
is used to eta-expand enclosed goal ("inverse-eta delay").

However, neither of them actually needed. Instead of `defer (g)` manual expansion can
be used:

```ocaml
(fun st -> Lazy.from_fun (fun () -> g st))
```

To get rid of `fresh` one can use `Fresh` module, which introduces variadic function
support by means of a few predefined numerals and a successor function. For
example, instead of

```ocaml
fresh (x y z) g
```

one can write

```ocaml
Fresh.three (fun x y z -> g)
```

or even

```ocaml
(Fresh.succ Fresh.two) (fun x y z -> g)
```

## Run

The top-level primitive in OCanren is `run`, which can be used in the following
pattern:

```ocaml
run n (fun q1 q2 ... qn -> g) (fun a1 a2 ... an -> h)
```

Here `n` stands for *numeral* (some value, describing the number of arguments, 
`q1`, `q2`, ..., `qn` --- free logic variables, `a1`, `a2`, ..., `an` --- streams
of answers for `q1`, `q2`, ..., `qn` respectively, `g` --- some goal, `h` --- a
*handler* (some piece of code, presumable making use of `a1`, `a2`, ..., `an`).

There are a few predefined numerals (`q`, `qr`, `qrs`, `qrst` etc.) and a
successor function, `succ`, which can be used to "manufacture" greater
numerals from smaller ones.

## Sample

We consider here a complete example of OCanren specification (relational
binary search tree):

```ocaml
open GT
open MiniKanren

(* Abstracted type for the tree *)
@type ('a, 'self) tree = Nil | Node of 'a * 'self * 'self with gmap, show

(* A shortcut for "ground" tree we're going to work with in "functional" code *)
type gtree = (int, gtree) tree

(* Logic counterpart *)
type ltree = (Nat.logic, ltree) tree logic

(* Printing ground tree function *)
let rec show_tree t = show(tree) (show(int)) show_tree t

(* Injection *)
let rec inj_tree : gtree -> ltree = fun t ->
  !! (gmap(tree) inj_nat inj_tree t)

(* Projection *)
let rec prj_tree : ltree -> gtree = fun t ->
  gmap(tree) prj_nat prj_tree (prj t)

(* Relational insert into a search tree *)
let rec inserto a t t' = conde [
  (t === !!Nil) &&& (t' === !!(Node (a, !!Nil, !!Nil)));
  fresh (x l r l')
    (t === !!(Node (x, l, r)))
    Nat.(conde [
      (t' === t) &&& (a === x);
      (t' === !!(Node (x, l', r ))) &&& (a < x) &&& (inserto a l l');
      (t' === !!(Node (x, l , l'))) &&& (a > x) &&& (inserto a r l')
    ])
]

(* Top-level wrapper for insertion --- takes and returns non-logic data *)
let insert a t =
  run q (fun q  -> inserto (inj_nat a) (inj_tree t) q)
        (fun qs -> prj_tree @@ Stream.hd qs)

(* Top-level wrapper for "inverse" insertion --- returns an integer, which
   has to be inserted to convert t into t' *)
let insert' t t' =
  run q (fun q  -> inserto q (inj_tree t) (inj_tree t'))
        (fun qs -> prj_nat @@ Stream.hd qs)  
```
